# 🏰 Best Practices in The Kingdom of app_csharp 🏰

In the mystical land of app_csharp, we honor the old traditions while embracing the new.

## 📘 Tome of Structure

- **Kingdom's Blueprint (Modular Structure)**: Our sacred texts (code files) are neatly categorized into Controllers, Services. A place for everything, and everything in its place.

## 🎨 Art of Coding

- **Elixirs (Dependency Injection)**: We harness ASP.NET Core's alchemy to brew powerful concoctions that bind our services.

- **Guardians at the Gate (Thin Controllers)**: Our sentinels ensure that no rogue logic enters the controllers.

- **Wise Sages (Service Layer)**: The heart of our logic, the service layer, is where our most learned scholars pen down their wisdom.

## 🛡️ Trials (Testing)

- **Sacred Rituals (xUnit)**: With xUnit, our trusty tool, we put our code through rigorous trials.

- **Mirrors and Shadows (Mocking)**: Using the magic mirror (Moq), we create reflections of our services for our tests to spar against.

- **The Three Pillars (AAA Pattern)**: Each test walks the sacred path of Arrange, Act, Assert to reach enlightenment.

## 🌌 Stars Align (Code Quality)

- **Omens in the Sky (Static Analysis)**: Star patterns (tools like Roslyn analyzers) warn us of impending doom (bugs or inconsistencies).
